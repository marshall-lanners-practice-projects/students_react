# Hatchways Frontend Assessment

## Getting Started

Once the dependancies are up and running use yarn or npm followed by start in your terminal. This will fire up a new server http://localhost:3000/ which will be hosting the React application.

## Brief overview

This is a project that retrieves student profiles from a server and displays the information in your browser. You are able to click the plus sign on each student profile to display their test scores along with a form to add a tag to the student profile. At the top of the webpage there are two form inputs where you can filter students by tag and or by their name first and last included.
